/*                     **** WHY TypeScript ****

- Static Typing: TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript. 
This means that you can explicitly specify the types of variables, function parameters, 
and return values. This helps catch type-related errors at compile-time rather than runtime, 
making your code more robust and easier to maintain.

- Improved Code Quality: With static typing, TypeScript can help you write cleaner 
and more self-documenting code.

- Cross-Platform Development: TypeScript can be used for both front-end and back-end development. You can 
write TypeScript for browser-based applications (client-side) and Node.js applications (server-side) with ease.*/
